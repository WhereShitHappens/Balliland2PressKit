## Balliland 2: Twilight Spell

### History

Angel Capital Ventures (previously Rebel Crew Games) have operated for over 10 years, in the development of mobile and online marketing solutions, gamification applications for marketing and training, online publishing and in-house game development.

Balliland XL came out almost 5 years ago and managed to cumulate over 3 million downloads and win a Webby award.


### Development

Balliland 2: Twilight spell is a puzzle game that takes pride in its non-derivative design, beautiful environments and original music. We really tried to create a unique vibe and experience that will resonate with the players.

The puzzles themselves are far from easy or brainless as you might've come to know. Each puzzle is hand crafted to provide a particular experience and most of the puzzles have alternative solutions.




### Features

* Relaxing, playfully-spooky vibe
* Constant addition of new, mind-challenging puzzles
* Charming characters and cute animations
* Panoramic view of all the levels for better perspective and puzzle solving
* No time or life limits
* Levels include an eerie Cemetery, cursed Catacombs and a haunted Castle
* Multiple solutions for most puzzles
* More than 90 puzzles of various difficulty levels
* Kid friendly, light hearted theme, perfect for the Halloween season
* Helpful hint system for those harder puzzles
* Various ways to acquire hints if you get stuck
* Original, Halloween themed music
* Constant support, updates and polishing
